            steep trail through the mountains, with an elevation gain of around
            2,000 meters (6,562 feet). The trail can be challenging, with some
            steep and rocky sections, and it can take anywhere from 5 to 7 hours
            to complete, depending on your pace. However, the trail is well
            marked and there are several rest stops along the way where you can

            physical condition and to be properly prepared with the right gear

            washrooms. However, it is important to keep in mind that these
            facilities may be more basic and rustic than what you are used to in
            a developed city or town. There are a few small guesthouses and
            lodges at Kheerganga that offer more comfortable accommodation, and
            these may have more modern and well-maintained washrooms. It is also
            a good idea to bring your own toilet paper and hand sanitizer, as
            these may not always be provided. In general, it is always a good
            idea to come prepared when traveling to remote or rural
            destinations, and to be mindful of the local infrastructure and
            facilities that are available.
