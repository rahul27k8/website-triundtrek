            <h3>Best Tips To Keep In Mind</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Take an Expert Guide</li>
              <li>
                If you are a beginner, then find an expert guide or an
                experienced person. It will help you in safely completing. Only
                an expert guide can explain the latest guidelines issued by the
                government. For example, the government banned night camping at
                hill to maintain eco-balance. So the only option left is guest
                houses under the forest department.
              </li>
              <li>Start Practice As Soon As Possible</li>
              <li>
                Before planning for this trek, start working on your strength
                and eat healthy food. Check whether your body is flexible enough
                to accept the changes. Develop an environment of trekking at
                your home and practice daily. It will work as a prevention from
                possible injury.
              </li>
              <li>Purchase Comfortable Trekking Shoe</li>
              <li>
                Comfort comes first when it comes to trekking to hill. Wearing
                comfortable shoes helps in completing the trek easily. Change
                your shoes immediately if you feel any discomfort that can not
                be avoidable. Avoid shoes that can cause blisters.
              </li>
              <li>Keep at least Two-pair of Shocks.</li>
              <li>
                Commonly, we forget to keep our favorite pair of shocks while
                backpacking. You are committing a mistake if you think
                comfortable shoes are enough to complete. So once you finalize
                the trekking shoe, pair up the right shocks with them. Check the
                material like fabric and necessary properties such as sweatproof
                and waterproof etc.
              </li>
              <li>Develop Will power and Leg Strength Through Exercise</li>
              <li>
                It is obvious that for an exciting trek, willpower and leg
                strength play a major role. Add bench press, squats, and other
                strength-building exercises to your daily schedule. Apart from
                leg strength, start working on willpower. Once you develop these
                elements, the Trek will become an exaggerating experience for
                you.
              </li>
              <li>Practice Walking on Daily Basis</li>
              <li>
                Every doctor suggests that walking is beneficial for our health.
                It keeps us physically fit and prepares us to map paths on the
                trek. Once you are a pro at walking, start practicing walking
                harder for trek. Develop an environment like Trek and become an
                excellent trekker.
              </li>
              <li>Start Training with Backpack</li>
              <li>
                If you think walking, exercising, and determination are enough,
                then let me tell you it is not. You will not get a complete idea
                of how trekking feels like. Whenever you practice walking, carry
                a backpack filled with the necessary trek items. Check how much
                weight you can lift comfortably.
              </li>
              <li>
                Also, choose a backpack whose straps you can easily adjust while
                walking. After training, you will get used to carrying a
                backpack.
              </li>
              <li>Start Using Walking Poles</li>
              <li>
                The use of lightweight walking poles while walking reduces
                pressure on your legs and thighs. It works as an additional leg
                that distributes the weight of the entire body. Apart from this,
                it has multiple uses, For example, keeping aside the vegetation
                and many others.
              </li>
              <li>Prevent Dehydration While Trekking</li>
              <li>
                Water is the basic need of the human body. We have always been
                taught by our elders that keep water with ourselves. Trek drains
                all your energy and demands the correct fluid level in the body.
                Climbing up the hill results in increased breath, loss of fluid,
                and increased heartbeat. So, drinking the right amount of fluid
                helps in balancing all of the above results. Due to lifestyle
                changes, we forget to take enough water throughout the day. So
                keep your body hydrated by sipping a small amount of water at
                different time intervals throughout the day.
              </li>
              <li>Develop Healthy Eating Habits</li>
              <li>
                Your eating habits determine how long you will go. Your body
                demands more food when it comes to trekking up the hill.
                Practice eating a small and healthy meal at different points of
                the day. The best options to take on the trek are fruits that
                help in increasing your energy level. Avoid eating fried snacks
                and other unhealthy food items.
              </li>
              <li>Examine Your Fitness</li>
              <li>
                Fitness is the key to win against challenges that we encounter
                throughout the trek. You have to invest your valuable time and
                energy to reach the trekking point, and fitness makes it easier
                for you. Fitness allows you to squeeze out every drop of
                happiness and joy.

                small tea stall on the hilltop. So the limited food shops you
                will get there sell at a higher cost. It is better to carry your
                food, energy-boosting fruits, and water to avoid dehydration.

                waste. Also, bring back your plastic-waste with you in your
